            <p className="aboutdesc">I always had a love for computers. It is growing even more during my undergrad in CSE. I enjoy making web applications completely from frontend to the backend and the database. MERN stack is my preference but I am always learning something new. With my knowledge I want to contribute to an organisation and grow myself even further.</p>
